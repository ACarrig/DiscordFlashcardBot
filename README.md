# DiscordFlashcardBot
A flashcard bot for discord, currently containing some Japanese vocabulary. 
  Any of the arrays can be altered to use whatever vocab is desired, but this
  project is geared towards studying Japanese.
  
The .pmx file contains dependencies and repositories copied from the discord
  website. When creating a bot the current version of discord as well as the
  aforementioned sections will likely be different (b/c of being newer versions)
  
The only command a user needs to know is -Commands to start using the bot
